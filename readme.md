# 3D-OLE / 5G AKI


Welcome to the repository for **3D-OLE and 5G AKI**.

<img title="5G AKI"  src="/images/platform.jpg" width="400" height="300">

This project integrates and manages various sensors to facilitate efficient inspection processes. The primary sensors used are:

- **WitMotion HW T9053-485**
- **RPLIDAR S2**
- **RealSense D345i**

These sensors work together to provide comprehensive data for accurate pipeline and crane inspections, leveraging the power of ROS2 for seamless sensor communication and data processing.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, and raise issues or pull requests to enhance the project's capabilities.
